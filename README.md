### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, n3ptune here!  
I fair a lot into technology and have a vast interest on computers, software and many hardware that consists on technology. I also wonder why a certain person let his GitHub username be sniped by me.

That person in particular is an absolute idiot who backstabs my friend maple and gaslights others into thinking maple is a bad person. If you got here from that person's Discord account...

# CONGRATS!!! YOU HAVE BEEN TRICKED BY THE FULLMOON EMPIRE!!!
